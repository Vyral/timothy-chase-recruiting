If you own a house using VA financing and want to rent it out, then buy another home with a second VA loan, you can. **However, the real question is how we treat your current house that you’re about to turn into a rental**. The VA has some very specific rules for that.

You can use your house as a rental, and although a bank might tell you that you need landlord experience, the VA doesn’t require it.

Do you need cash reserves when converting your property to a rental? **Again, the VA says no, but the bank will typically require at least a few months of reserves**.

Finally, can you count your extra rent money as income? The answer is no. **You can only use the rental amount to offset your current mortgage**.
