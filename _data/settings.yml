    Tim Chase was born in Canon City, Colorado and has lived in Southern Colorado for most of his life.  Currently living in Colorado Springs, Tim has many years of Real Estate finance experience.  Although Mortgages take up most of the day, after work you can find Tim and his family on a quick hike or bicycle ride through local trails.  Tim has received many sales and leadership accolades but none can compare to his desire to be the best father and a husband he can be.
