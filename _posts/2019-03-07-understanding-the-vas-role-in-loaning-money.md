The VA doesn’t loan money to veterans.

No, we’re not reporting a recent change in the VA’s policy, but we are trying to create a more informed understanding of how VA loans actually work.

**Here’s what you need to know**.

The United States Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) sets its own basic guidelines, and the bank loans the money to the veterans. Here’s why that’s important: **The VA provides the initial guidelines to the banks, but the banks can then add more guidelines on top of those**.

What do you do if you think that your client has a shot at getting a VA loan, but they’ve previously been denied by a bank? Call a mortgage broker, another bank, or another relevant entity to **see if the issue is due to a VA rule or if it’s what we in the mortgage business call an overlay—a rule created by the bank to overlay a normal VA rule**.

This is an important distinction because the VA, in general, is fairly relaxed in a lot of areas, and we need to make sure that we get our veterans into houses if we can. Let’s help those who have helped and served us and our country so well.
