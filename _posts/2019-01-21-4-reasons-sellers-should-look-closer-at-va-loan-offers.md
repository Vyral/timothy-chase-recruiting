<center><em>Believe it or not, VA offers are often the better loan option when considered against conventional or FHA loans. Here&rsquo;s why.</em></center>

&nbsp;

There’s a persistent myth promulgated around the real estate community that an offer on a home done through a VA loan is “weak” in comparison to conventional offers. I’d like to present four points that demonstrate that this isn’t the case:

**1. Income**. The average household income for veterans is $73,000 per year, and that often comes from two income sources. A good number of them also receive VA benefits, disability, etc. All of this makes for a very dependable income.

**2. Credit score**. While it’s true that veterans have quite a bit more leniency with their score, don’t let this fool you—the average score for veterans is actually a 738!

**3. Loan performance**. This may be news to you, but VA loans perform better than any other loan in the country. Their default rate is at less than 2%, which ranks better than FHA and even conventional loans with 20% down. What’s more, lenders will not pass these loans up; they’re extremely good for their portfolio.

**4. They’ve earned it**. Providing veterans with 100% financing and all the benefits that come with a VA loan are just small ways we can repay them for the sacrifices they’ve laid forth in the service of our country. Let’s make sure they have every shot to buy a home with a VA offer. &nbsp;
