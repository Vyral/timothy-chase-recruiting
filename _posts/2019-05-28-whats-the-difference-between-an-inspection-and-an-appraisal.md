An appraisal is required by the VA when veterans go to purchase a home, but the home inspection is optional. Sometimes, veterans get confused because it feels like the appraiser is inspecting the home, and to a point, they are—appraisers do inspect a few things, but that’s limited to health and safety issues such as broken glass, peeling paint, etc. However, **the ultimate point of an appraiser’s job is to determine the value of the home to make sure that you’re getting a fair deal on the house**.

If you want a full inspection, you’ll need to hire an inspector yourself. Their prices can range anywhere from $250 all the way up to $550, depending on the house and situation. Their job is to look at every system in the home, including the HVAC system, electricity, insulation, and so on, to make sure that everything functions the way it should and is safe. They work on a much larger scope than an appraiser.
