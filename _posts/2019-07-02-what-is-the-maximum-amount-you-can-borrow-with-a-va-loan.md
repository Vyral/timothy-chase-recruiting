Many people ask me what the maximum amount you can borrow with a VA loan is, and the answer may surprise you. Actually, **there is no set maximum**. Instead, **individual banks set their own lending standards**. There is a maximum county loan limit, but this only comes into play if you want to borrow 100% with zero money down. Given that this limit varies between counties, the best way for you to determine what limits you might face is to search online for VA loan limits in your specific county.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
